File naming convention
Each RAVDESS file has a unique filename. The filename consists of a 7-part numerical identifier (e.g., 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4).
These identifiers define the stimulus characteristics:

Filename identifiers
Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).

Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).
Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.
Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door").
Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).
